Filtering cells standard task scRNA-seq quality control (QC), though lacks standardisation practice. majority approaches filter damaged cells according deviations cell-level QC metrics. outlier-based detection implicitly assumes viable cells follow unimodal distributions across QC metrics, deviation synonymous damage. assumption falters context heterogeneous data risks introducing filtering bias related cell type abundance. Recent methods address defining damage within distinct distributions, representing cell populations, independently. , however, assumes distinct distributions associated viable cell populations risks leaving abundant damage undetected ultimately misclassified.
