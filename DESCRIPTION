Description: DamageDetective detects and filters damaged cells in single-cell 
    RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets using a novel approach inspired by 
    DoubletFinder. It compares each cell’s gene expression profile to simulated 
    “damaged” versions of itself, quantifying damage severity based on the 
    probabilistic escape of cytoplasmic RNA. This results in a damage score 
    ranging from 0 to 1 for each cell. By aligning with biological definitions 
    of damage, the method offers a more reliable and standardised approach for 
    cleaning scRNA-seq data across diverse cell types, samples, and experiments.
