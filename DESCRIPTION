Description: Detects and filters damaged cells in single-cell RNA sequencing 
    (scRNA-seq) data using a novel approach inspired by 'DoubletFinder'. Damage 
    is assessed by measuring how much each cell deviates from an artificially 
    damaged version of itself, simulated through the probabilistic loss of 
    cytoplasmic RNA. The method outputs a damage score ranging from 0 (viable,
    intact cell) to 1 (broken, non-viable cell), providing an intuitive scale 
    for filtering that is standardised across cell types, sample origin, and 
    experimental design.
