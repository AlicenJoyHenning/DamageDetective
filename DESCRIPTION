Description: Detects and filters damaged cells in single-cell RNA sequencing
    (scRNA-seq) data using a novel approach inspired by 'DoubletFinder'. Damage
    is detected by measuring the extent to which cells deviate from
    artificially damaged profiles of themselves, simulated through the
    probabilistic escape of cytoplasmic RNA. As output, a damage score
    ranging from 0 to 1 is given for each cell providing an intuitive scale for 
    filtering that is standardised across cell types, samples and experiments.
